# MachineLearning
Assorted files from my exploration of machine learning

*ann_model_original.py* - My own multilayer perceptron (MLP) class coded from scratch. Uses the Numba library to do some jit compilation to improve performance. I used this code for research until I started using PyTorch for faster prototyping.

*ergence_feature_extraction.py* - Classes used to extract features from audio data for voice activity detection (VAD) classification.
