# MachineLearning
Assorted files from my exploration of machine learning

*ann_model_original.py* - My own multilayer perceptron (MLP) class coded from scratch. Uses the Numba library to do some jit compilation as well as multithreading to reduce training time on CPU. I used this code for research until I started using PyTorch for faster prototyping.

*ANN_Model.py* - PyTorch implementation of my original MLP class. 

*ergence_feature_extraction.py* - Classes used to extract features from audio data for voice activity detection (VAD) classification.
